### Indonesian Cabinet Member Database (1945-2017)

Complete database can be found in Final Database folder. A quick guide to the CSV files inside:
- Singulars: Primary table containing basic attributes of each individual. **This is the master file! Use this as a base to join all other files to.**
- Positions: Lists all the offices/positions each individual has ever had.
- Parties: Lists the political parties each individual has ever been a member of.
- Education: Lists all the educational institutions each individual has ever attended.
- Family: Lists all the family members of each individual.

Further details can be found in the Final Paper. Code appendices provide the code that I used to construct this. Happy stalking!
